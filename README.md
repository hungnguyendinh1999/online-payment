# Django Server
This is the repo for Online Payment Server. I use Python, Django Framework and Django Rest Framework. For the database, I'm using MongoDB.


### Stripe APIs
I'm using Stripe's Card, Payment, and Customer APIs to build the base of this online-payment solution app.
The main idea is to be able to add, delete, update customers with less code without looking into too much of the syntax and implementation of Stripe API (since everything is pretty much set-up)
